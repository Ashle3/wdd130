            <h1>Meet Charlie!</h1>
                <p>Charlie is a 5-year-old male Pug that has been with us since February. He is known as the "Little Love Bug Pug" because of how much he loves to cuddle. Some of Charlie's favorite activities include getting treats and playing outside. He is great with other dogs and, as you can tell by his nickname, loves humans. He is a perfect family dog! Say hello to our Little Love Bug Pug, Charlie!!</p>
                <h2>Special Considerations</h2>
                <p>Because of their squishy faces and the way they were bred, pugs are known to have many health problems. Charlie's ideal owner would be one who is willing to tend to his health needs and is willing to pay for his vet bills. Another thing to know about pugs is their wrinkles. It is best practice to clean between Charlie's wrinkles on a daily basis to prevent infection. </p>
                <p>If you are interested in adopting Charlie, please call us at <strong>111-222-3333</strong> or email us at <strong>bestfriends@email.com</strong>. You can also drop by our shelter located at <strong>123 Main Street</strong> in Anytown, Texas. The adoption fee is $50. </p>
