            <h1>Meet Chewy!</h1>
                <p>Much like the adorable Star Wars character he is named after, Chewy is a gentle giant. He is an 11-year-old, male, mixed breed dog that is sweet to everyone he meets. He is a laid-back dog who takes his naps very seriously. Since he is in his older years, it is advised that he goes to a home that does not have small children and does not have overly energetic dogs. That being said, he is a lovable dog that would make a great addition to anyone's home. Say hello to the gentle giant, Chewy</p>
                <h2>Special Considerations</h2>
                <p>Because Chewy is in his older years, he has a few age-related health problems, including swollen joints. He is also blind in one eye, but that hardly affects his navigation skills. It would be best if he went an owner that is okay paying the expensive vet bills that will come with his health problems.</p>
                <p>If you are interested in adopting Chewy, please call us at <strong>111-222-3333</strong> or email us at <strong>bestfriends@email.com</strong>. You can also drop by our shelter located at <strong>123 Main Street</strong> in Anytown, Texas. The adoption fee is $50. </p>
