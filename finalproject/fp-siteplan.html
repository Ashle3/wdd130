        <h3>Site Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            I want to create a website that would give information on and promote a fictional dog rescue organization. 
            The website would give information on the dogs that are available for adoption and would encourage people to 
            adopt said dogs. Something unique about the website; you could take a personality quiz to see what kind of dog 
            would be best suited for your needs. It would be an overall fun and interactive experience for everyone who visits 
            the site.

            <h3>Site Audience</h3>
            <p>
                As of now, the target audience will be animal lovers who are looking to adopt a rescue dog. 
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Is this rescue organization credible? Do they know what they are doing?</li>
            <li>What makes this rescue different from others I have seen?</li>
            <li>Is the rescue friendly? Would it be easy to adopt from them?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>I will use blue as the main color, since it is a calming color. hex #0081A7 rgb: 0, 129, 167</li>
            <li>I will use some yellow or golds as accent colors because they are happy/positive colors. hex #222255 rgb: 34 34 85</li>
            <li>I will use light gray or white as background colors. </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Site Typography</h3>
            <p>I will use sans serif for normal text and times new roman for headers</p>
