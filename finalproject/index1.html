            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <h2>How We Began</h2>
            <p>Best Friends Dog Rescue was founded in 2014 by Barbara Lee. Before then, Barbara was working as a vet tech at her local animal shelter. The animal shelter was not a 'no-kill' shelter, meaning if the shelter was too full and resources were running thin, the animals who had been there the longest were put down, or euthanized. Being the vet tech, putting the animals down was one of Barbara's duties. After a while, Barbara started to wonder if there was anything else that could be done besides euthanization. 'What more of a difference can I make?' She would ask this to herself constantly. Then, early 2014, Barbara got an idea, quit her job at the shelter, and founded the Best Friends Dog Rescue which, we are proud to say, is still going strong today thanks to the efforts of dedicated employees and volunteers alike! </p>
            <p> </p>
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission here at Best Friends Dog Rescue, is to ensure that every dog finds a home, and that not one of them has to be put down due to lack of resources. The reason our organization focuses on rescuing dogs is because, they were the ones that were most often put down at the animal shelter Barbara Lee worked at. Althoug our organization is mainly focused on dogs, we never turn away another animal in need.</p>
