        <h1>About US</h1>
        <section>
            <p>
            The Dry Oar Rafting Company has been around since 1967. We are located here in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, near Yellowstone National Park.
            Our founder, Mr. Jim Brewer, believed in the healing power nature can provide, and how being outdoors, even for just a day, can really
            refresh a person's mind and overall well-being. Wanting to find a way to share the outdoors with others, Brewer first sought to invite 
            close friends and relatives on monthly trips down the river near his cabin. These trips were well-loved by all who attended. Notably, 
            the attendees loved Brewer's expertise, and the knowledge he shared about the river during these trips. His love for the outdoors was 
            clear, and his enthusiasm was infectious. Five years after these river trips started, Brewer wanted to invite more people, and thus, 
            Dry Oar was born.
            </p>
            <p>
            Here at Dry Oar, we strive to share the enthusiasm Jim Brewer had for the outdoors with others. Our certified river guides have years 
            of whitewater experience, and are happy to answer any questions you may have along the way.
