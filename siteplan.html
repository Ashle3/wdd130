           <h3>Site Purpose</h3>
           <p>The purpose of this site is to help users learn about our company and its standards, learn 
               what to expect when going on one of our rafting expeditions (including overall experience,
               price, payment options, etc.), and easily schedule appointments 
               for a rafting expedition. Our goal is for the site to be user friendly and easy to navigate.
